You can use it to quickly bootstrap your angular webapp projects and dev environment for these
projects.

The angular seed this app is based on relies on a number of node.js tools to initialize and test angular-seed. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).
